# Loan Status Prediction Model

## Overview
The Loan Status Prediction Model is a machine learning project that utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied. The model leverages various applicant features to make accurate predictions, aiding financial institutions in streamlining their loan approval processes.

## Features
- **Binary Classification:** Predicts loan approval status as either approved (1) or denied (0).
- **Comprehensive Features:** Considers multiple applicant attributes such as gender, marital status, dependents, education, and employment status.
- **High Accuracy:** Employs an SVM classifier to achieve high predictive performance and reliability.

## Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - **Scikit-Learn:** For building and evaluating the SVM classifier.
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data processing.
  - **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and analysis.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Imports and loads the loan application dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the data by  encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
3. **Model Training:** Trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel on the preprocessed dataset to predict loan approval status.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using accuracy metrics on both training and test datasets to ensure its effectiveness.
5. **Prediction:** Uses the trained SVM model to predict loan approval status for new or unseen applications based on provided features.

## Usage
- **For Financial Institutions:** Assists in automating and improving the accuracy of loan approval decisions.
- **For Data Scientists:** Provides a practical example of applying SVM for binary classification tasks.
- **For Applicants:** Offers insights into factors that influence loan approval decisions.
